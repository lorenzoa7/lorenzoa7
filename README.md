# üí´ About Me:
Software Developer focused on frontend, specialized in technologies such as React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Node.js and Fastify. I have experience in projects involving the creation of modern and responsive user interfaces using these technologies.

I currently work as a software developer on an AI system to predict equipment risks for the largest company in Brazil.
